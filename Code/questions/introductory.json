{"id": 3324, "question": "In JavaScript, ```if..else``` is the most basic condition statement,\nit consists of three parts:```condition, statement1, statement2```, like this:\n```python\nif condition: statementa\nelse:         statementb\n```\nIt means that if the condition is true, then execute the statementa, otherwise execute the statementb.If the statementa or statementb more than one line, you need to add ```{``` and ```}``` at the head and tail of statement in JS, to keep the same indentation on Python and to put a `end` in Ruby where it indeed ends.\n\nAn example, if we want to judge whether a number is odd or even, we can write code like this:\n```python\ndef odd_even(n):\n    if n%2: return \"odd number\"\n    else:   return \"even number\"\n```\n\nIf there is more than one condition to judge, we can use the compound if...else statement. an example:\n```python\ndef old_young(age):\n    if age<16:        return \"children\"\n    elif (age<50): return \"young man\" #use \"else if\" if needed\n    else:             return \"old man\"\n```\nThis function returns a different value depending on the parameter age.\n\nLooks very complicated? Well, JS and Ruby also support the ```ternary operator``` and Python has something similar too:\n```python\nstatementa if condition else statementb\n```\nCondition and statement separated by \"?\", different statement separated by \":\" in both Ruby and JS; in Python you put the condition in the middle of two alternatives.\nThe two examples above can be simplified with ternary operator:\n```python\ndef odd_even(n):\n    return \"odd number\" if n%2 else \"even number\"\ndef old_young(age):\n    return \"children\" if age<16 else \"young man\" if age<50 else \"old man\"\n```\n\n## Task:\nComplete function `saleHotdogs`/`SaleHotDogs`/`sale_hotdogs`, function accept 1  parameters:`n`, n is the number of customers to buy hotdogs, different numbers have different prices (refer to the following table), return a number that the customer need to pay how much money.\n```\n+---------------+-------------+\n|  numbers n    | price(cents)|\n+---------------+-------------+\n|n<5            |    100      |\n+---------------+-------------+\n|n>=5 and n<10  |     95      |\n+---------------+-------------+\n|n>=10          |     90      |\n+---------------+-------------+\n```\nYou can use if..else or ternary operator to complete it.\n    \n    When you have finished the work, click \"Run Tests\" to see if your code is working properly.\n    \n    In the end, click \"Submit\" to submit your code pass this kata.\n    \n## [Series](http://github.com/myjinxin2015/Katas-list-of-Training-JS-series):\n\n( ↑↑↑ Click the link above can get my newest kata list, Please add it to your favorites)\n\n -

You need to ask \"One beer please\": \"Jedno piwo poprosze\"\n\n``` java\nTranslator.orderingBeers(1) = \"Jedno piwo poprosze\"\n```\n\nBut let's say you are really thirsty and want several beers. Then you need to count in Polish. And more difficult, you need to understand the Polish grammar and cases (nominative, genitive, accustative and more).\n\n## The grammar\n\nIn English, the plural of \"beer\" is simply \"beers\", with an \"s\". \n\nIn Polish, the plural of \"piwo\" (nominative singular) is \"piw\" (genitive plural) or \"piwa\" (nominative plural). It depends!\n\n\nThe rules:\n\n* usually the plural is genitive: \"piw\"\n* but after the numerals 2, 3, 4, and compound numbers ending with them (e.g. 22, 23, 24), the noun is plural and takes the same case as the numeral, so nominative: \"piwa\"\n* and exception to the exception: for 12, 13 and 14, it's the genitive plural again: \"piw\" (yes, I know, it's crazy!)\n\n\n## The numbers\n\nFrom 0 to 9:\n    \n    \"zero\", \"jeden\", \"dwa\", \"trzy\", \"cztery\", \"piec\", \"szesc\" , \"siedem\", \"osiem\", \"dziewiec\"\n\nFrom 10 to 19 it's nearly the same, with \"-ascie\" at the end:\n\n    \"dziesiec\", \"jedenascie\", \"dwanascie\", \"trzynascie\", \"czternascie\", \"pietnascie\", \"szesnascie\", \"siedemnascie\", \"osiemnascie\", \"dziewietnascie\"\n\nTens from 10 to 90 are nearly the same, with \"-ziesci\" or \"ziesiat\" at the end:\n\n    \"dziesiec\", \"dwadziescia\", \"trzydziesci\", \"czterdziesci\", \"piecdziesiat\", \"szescdziesiat\", \"siedemdziesiat\", \"osiemdziesiat\", \"dziewiecdziesiat\"\n\nCompound numbers are constructed similarly to English: tens + units. For example, 22 is \"dwadziescia dwa\".\n\n\"One\" could be male (\"Jeden\"), female (\"Jedna\") or neuter (\"Jedno\"), which is the case for \"beer\" (piwo). But all other numbers are invariant, even if ending with \"jeden\".\n\nAh, and by the way, if you don't want to drink alcohol (so no beers are ordered), ask for mineral water instead: \"Woda mineralna\".\n\nNote: if the number of beers is outside your (limited) Polish knowledge (0-99), raise an error!\n\n---\nMore about the crazy polish grammar: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_grammar", "input_output": [{"input": [0], "output": ["Woda mineralna poprosze"]}, {"input": [1], "output": ["Jedno piwo poprosze"]}, {"input": [2], "output": ["Dwa piwa poprosze"]}, {"input": [3], "output": ["Trzy piwa poprosze"]}, {"input": [4], "output": ["Cztery piwa poprosze"]}, {"input": [5], "output": ["Piec piw poprosze"]}, {"input": [8], "output": ["Osiem piw poprosze"]}, {"input": [10], "output": ["Dziesiec piw poprosze"]}, {"input": [11], "output": ["Jedenascie piw poprosze"]}, {"input": [12], "output": ["Dwanascie piw poprosze"]}, {"input": [13], "output": ["Trzynascie piw poprosze"]}, {"input": [14], "output": ["Czternascie piw poprosze"]}, {"input": [15], "output": ["Pietnascie piw poprosze"]}, {"input": [16], "output": ["Szesnascie piw poprosze"]}, {"input": [20], "output": ["Dwadziescia piw poprosze"]}, {"input": [21], "output": ["Dwadziescia jeden piw poprosze"]}, {"input": [22], "output": ["Dwadziescia dwa piwa poprosze"]}, {"input": [28], "output": ["Dwadziescia osiem piw poprosze"]}, {"input": [33], "output": ["Trzydziesci trzy piwa poprosze"]}, {"input": [44], "output": ["Czterdziesci cztery piwa poprosze"]}, {"input": [55], "output": ["Piecdziesiat piec piw poprosze"]}, {"input": [98], "output": ["Dziewiecdziesiat osiem piw poprosze"]}, {"input": [99], "output": ["Dziewiecdziesiat dziewiec piw poprosze"]}]}
