  "prompt": "## Witamy!\n\nYou are in Poland and want to order a drink. You need to ask \"One beer please\": \"Jedno piwo poprosze\"\n\n``` java\nTranslator.orderingBeers(1) = \"Jedno piwo poprosze\"\n```\n\nBut let's say you are really thirsty and want several beers. Then you need to count in Polish. And more difficult, you need to understand the Polish grammar and cases (nominative, genitive, accustative and more).\n\n## The grammar\n\nIn English, the plural of \"beer\" is simply \"beers\", with an \"s\". \n\nIn Polish, the plural of \"piwo\" (nominative singular) is \"piw\" (genitive plural) or \"piwa\" (nominative plural). It depends!\n\n\nThe rules:\n\n* usually the plural is genitive: \"piw\"\n* but after the numerals 2, 3, 4, and compound numbers ending with them (e.g. 22, 23, 24), the noun is plural and takes the same case as the numeral, so nominative: \"piwa\"\n* and exception to the exception: for 12, 13 and 14, it's the genitive plural again: \"piw\" (yes, I know, it's crazy!)\n\n\n## The numbers\n\nFrom 0 to 9:\n    \n    \"zero\", \"jeden\", \"dwa\", \"trzy\", \"cztery\", \"piec\", \"szesc\" , \"siedem\", \"osiem\", \"dziewiec\"\n\nFrom 10 to 19 it's nearly the same, with \"-ascie\" at the end:\n\n    \"dziesiec\", \"jedenascie\", \"dwanascie\", \"trzynascie\", \"czternascie\", \"pietnascie\", \"szesnascie\", \"siedemnascie\", \"osiemnascie\", \"dziewietnascie\"\n\nTens from 10 to 90 are nearly the same, with \"-ziesci\" or \"ziesiat\" at the end:\n\n    \"dziesiec\", \"dwadziescia\", \"trzydziesci\", \"czterdziesci\", \"piecdziesiat\", \"szescdziesiat\", \"siedemdziesiat\", \"osiemdziesiat\", \"dziewiecdziesiat\"\n\nCompound numbers are constructed similarly to English: tens + units. For example, 22 is \"dwadziescia dwa\".\n\n\"One\" could be male (\"Jeden\"), female (\"Jedna\") or neuter (\"Jedno\"), which is the case for \"beer\" (piwo). But all other numbers are invariant, even if ending with \"jeden\".\n\nAh, and by the way, if you don't want to drink alcohol (so no beers are ordered), ask for mineral water instead: \"Woda mineralna\".\n\nNote: if the number of beers is outside your (limited) Polish knowledge (0-99), raise an error!\n\n---\nMore about the crazy polish grammar: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_grammar",
