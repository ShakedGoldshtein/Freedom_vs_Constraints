  "prompt": "Write a function that accepts two square matrices (`N x N` two dimensional arrays), and return the sum of the two. Both matrices being passed into the function will be of size `N x N` (square), containing only integers.\n\nHow to sum two matrices:\n\nTake each cell `[n][m]` from the first matrix, and add it with the same `[n][m]` cell from the second matrix. This will be cell `[n][m]` of the solution matrix.\n\nVisualization: \n```\n|1 2 3|     |2 2 1|     |1+2 2+2 3+1|     |3 4 4|\n|3 2 1|  +  |3 2 3|  =  |3+3 2+2 1+3|  =  |6 4 4|\n|1 1 1|     |1 1 3|     |1+1 1+1 1+3|     |2 2 4|\n```\n\n## Example",
