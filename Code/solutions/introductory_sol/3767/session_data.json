  "prompt": "Coding decimal numbers with factorials is a way of writing out numbers \nin a base system that depends on factorials, rather than powers of numbers.\n\nIn this system, the last digit is always `0` and is in base 0!. The digit before that is either `0 or 1` and is in base 1!.  The digit before that is either `0, 1, or 2` and is in base 2!, etc.\nMore generally, the nth-to-last digit is always `0, 1, 2, ..., n` and is in base n!.\n\nRead more about it at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial_number_system\n\n\n## Example\n\nThe decimal number `463` is encoded as `\"341010\"`, because:\n\n463 = 3\u00d75! + 4\u00d74! + 1\u00d73! + 0\u00d72! + 1\u00d71! + 0\u00d70!\n\n\nIf we are limited to digits `0..9`, the biggest number we can encode is 10!-1 (= 3628799). So we extend `0..9` with letters `A..Z`. With these 36 digits we can now encode numbers up to 36!-1 (= 3.72 \u00d7 10^(41))\n\n\n## Task\n\nWe will need two functions. The first one will receive a decimal number and return a string with the factorial representation.\n\n~~~if:java\n**Note:** the input number is at most a long.\n~~~\n\nThe second one will receive a string with a factorial representation and produce the decimal representation.\n\nGiven numbers will always be positive.",
