  "prompt": "> In information theory and computer science, the Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (i.e. insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.\n\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance)\n\n\nYour task is to implement a function which calculates the Levenshtein distance for two arbitrary strings.",
