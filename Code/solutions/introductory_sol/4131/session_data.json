  "prompt": "My washing machine uses ```water``` amount of water to wash ```clothes``` amount of clothes. You are given a ```load``` amount of clothes to wash.  For each single item of load above the standard amount of clothes, the washing machine will use 10% more water (multiplicative) to clean.\nFor example, if the amount of clothes is ```10```, the amount of water it requires is ```5``` and the load is  ```14```, then you need ```5 * 1.1 ^ (14 - 10)``` amount of water.\n\nWrite a function ```howMuchWater``` (JS)/```how_much_water``` (Python) to work out how much water is needed if you have a ```clothes``` amount of clothes.  The function will accept 3 parameters - ```howMuchWater(water, load, clothes)``` / ```how_much_water(water, load, clothes)```\n\nMy washing machine is an old model that can only handle double the amount of ```load```.  If the amount of ```clothes``` is more than 2 times the standard amount of ```load```, return ```'Too much clothes'```.  The washing machine also cannot handle any amount of clothes less than ```load```.  If that is the case, return ```'Not enough clothes'```.\n\nThe answer should be rounded to the nearest 2 decimal places.",
