  "prompt": "=====Problem Statement=====\nYou are given a set A and n other sets.\nYour job is to find whether set A is a strict superset of each of the N sets.\nPrint True, if A is a strict superset of each of the N sets. Otherwise, print False.\nA strict superset has at least one element that does not exist in its subset.\n\n=====Example=====\nSet([1,3,4]) is a strict superset of set([1,3]).\nSet([1,3,4]) is not a strict superset of set([1,3,4]).\nSet([1,3,4]) is not a strict superset of set(1,3,5).\n\n=====Input Format=====\nThe first line contains the space separated elements of set A.\nThe second line contains integer n, the number of other sets.\nThe next n lines contains the space separated elements of the other sets.\n\n=====Constraints=====\n0 < len(set(A)) < 501\n0<N<21\n0 < len(otherSets) < 101\n\n=====Output Format=====\nPrint True if set A is a strict superset of all other N sets. Otherwise, print False.",
