  "prompt": "A little weird green frog speaks in a very strange variation of English: it reverses sentence, omitting all puntuation marks  `, ; ( ) - ` except the final exclamation, question or period. We urgently need help with building a proper translator.\nTo simplify the task, we always use lower-case letters. Apostrophes are forbidden as well.\n\nTranslator should be able to process multiple sentences in one go. Sentences are separated by arbitrary amount of spaces.\n\n**Examples**\n\n`you should use python.` -> `python use should you.`\n\n`look, a fly!` -> `fly a look!`\n\n`multisentence is good. is not it?` -> `good is multisentence. it not is?`",
