  "prompt": "When you divide the successive powers of `10` by `13` you get the following remainders of the integer divisions:  \n\n`1, 10, 9, 12, 3, 4`. \n\nThen the whole pattern repeats.\n\nHence the following method:\nMultiply the right most digit of the number with the left most number \nin the sequence shown above, the second right most digit to the second \nleft most digit of the number in the sequence. The cycle goes on and you sum all these products. Repeat this process until the sequence of sums is stationary.\n\n...........................................................................\n\nExample: What is the remainder when `1234567` is divided by `13`?\n\n`7\u00d71 + 6\u00d710 + 5\u00d79 + 4\u00d712 + 3\u00d73 + 2\u00d74 + 1\u00d71 = 178`\n\nWe repeat the process with 178:\n\n`8x1 + 7x10 + 1x9 = 87`\n\nand again with 87:\n\n`7x1 + 8x10 = 87`\n\n...........................................................................\n\nFrom now on the sequence is stationary and the remainder of `1234567` by `13` is \nthe same as the remainder of `87` by `13`: `9`\n\nCall `thirt` the function which processes this sequence of operations on an integer `n (>=0)`. `thirt` will return the stationary number.\n\n`thirt(1234567)` calculates 178, then 87, then 87 and returns `87`.\n\n`thirt(321)` calculates 48, 48 and returns `48`",
