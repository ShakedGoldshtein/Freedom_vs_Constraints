Work out who wins.\n\nReturn a string\n\n* `O wins after  moves`\n* `X wins after  moves`\n* `No winner`\n\n# Rules\n\n* Player `O` always goes first\n* Input `moves` is list/array/tuple of `[x,y,z]` (zero based)\n* Each player takes a turn until you find a winner, or there are no moves left\n* Four of the same symbols in a row wins\n* There may be more moves provided than are necessary to finish the game - that is for you to figure out\n\n\n\nGood Luck!\nDM",
