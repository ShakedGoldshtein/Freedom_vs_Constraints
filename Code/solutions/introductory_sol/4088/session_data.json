  "prompt": "# Fun fact\nTetris was the first video game played in outer space\n\nIn 1993, Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr A. Serebrov spent 196 days on the Mir space station with a very special distraction: a gray Game Boy loaded with Tetris. During that time the game orbited the Earth 3,000 times and became the first video game played in space. The Game Boy was sold in a Bonhams auction for $1,220 during the Space History Sale in 2011.\n\n# Task\nParse the game log and determine how many lines have been cleared through the game. The game ends if all commands from input were interpreted or the maximum field height (30 units) is reached.\n\nA horizontal line, according to the rules of classic Tetris, is considered cleared if it represents a solid line without gaps formed by falling blocks.\nWhen such a line is formed, it disappears and any blocks above it fall down to fill the space.\n\n# Input\n```python\n['4L2', '3R4', '4L3', '3L4', '4R0', '1L2'] # example\n```\nAs an argument, you are given gamelog - an array of commands which you need to interpret.\n\nEach command has the same form:\n* The first character - the type of block (integer from 1 to 4, as in this kata we have only 4 types of blocks). Block types are described below.\n* The second - the direction of movement (`\"R\"` or `\"L\"` - right or left).\n* The third is an offset (integer from 0 to 4, as width of our field 9 units and new block always appears at the center of the field) relative to the starting position. Thus, `L4` means the leftmost position, and `R4` the rightmost, and `L0` is equivalent to `R0`.\n\n# Output\nThe total number of cleaned horizontal lines (`int`) to the end of the game. Note, if the field height is exceeded, then the game ends immediately.\n\n# Blocks\nIn this kata we have only 4 types of blocks. Yes, this is not a classic set of shapes, but this is only for simplicity.\n```\n# and their graphical representation:\n             \u25a0\n         \u25a0   \u25a0\n     \u25a0   \u25a0   \u25a0\n \u25a0   \u25a0   \u25a0   \u25a0\n---+---+---+---\n#1  #2  #3  #4\n```\n# Field\nGamefield (a rectangular vertical shaft) has width 9 units and height 30 units.\n\n\ntable, th, td {\n  border: 1px solid;\n}\n\n\nIndices can be represented as:\n\n\nL4\nL3\nL2\nL1\nL0/R0\nR1\nR2\nR3\nR4\n\n\n\n# Example 1\n```python\n>>> gamelog = ['1R4', '2L3', '3L2', '4L1', '1L0', '2R1', '3R2', '4R3', '1L4']\n>>> tetris(gamelog)\n1\n```\nGamefield before last command (_ means empty space):\n```\n___\u25a0___\u25a0_\n__\u25a0\u25a0__\u25a0\u25a0_\n_\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0_\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0_\n_\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\n```\nGamefield after all commands:\n```\n___\u25a0___\u25a0_\n__\u25a0\u25a0__\u25a0\u25a0_\n_\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0_\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0_\n```\nAs you can see, one solid line was cleared. So, answer is 1.\n\n# Example 2\n```python\n>>> gamelog = ['1L2', '4R2', '3L3', '3L1', '1L4', '1R4']\n>>> tetris(gamelog)\n0\n```\nGamefield after all commands:\n```\n _____\u25a0__\n_\u25a0_\u25a0__\u25a0__\n_\u25a0_\u25a0__\u25a0__\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0__\u25a0_\u25a0\n```\nAs you can see, there is no solid lines, so nothing to clear. Our answer is 0, zero cleaned lines.\n\n# Note\n\nSince there is no rotation of blocks in our model and all blocks are very simple, do not overthink the task.\n\n# Other  \n\nIf you like the idea: leave feedback, and there will be more katas in the Tetris series.\n\n* 7 kyuTetris Series #1 \u2014 Scoring System\n* 6 kyuTetris Series #2 \u2014 Primitive Gameplay\n* 6 kyuTetris Series #3 \u2014 Adding Rotation (TBA)\n* 5 kyuTetris Series #4 \u2014 New Block Types (TBA)\n* 4 kyuTetris Series #5 \u2014 Complex Block Types (TBA?)",
