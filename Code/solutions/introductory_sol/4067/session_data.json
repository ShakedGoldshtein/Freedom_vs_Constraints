  "prompt": "Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is `to find out which one of the given numbers differs from the others`. Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in **evenness**. Help Bob \u2014 to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number.\n\n`!` Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a `real IQ test`, which means indexes of the elements start from `1 (not 0)`\n\n##Examples :\n\n \n```python\niq_test(\"2 4 7 8 10\") => 3 // Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even\n\niq_test(\"1 2 1 1\") => 2 // Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd\n```",
