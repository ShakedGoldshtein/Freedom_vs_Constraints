Your task is to find the longest substring in `str`(all brackets in the substring are closed). The result is the length of the longest substring.\n\n For example:\n ```\n str = \"()()(\"\n findLongest(str) === 4 \n \"()()\" is the longest substring\n ```\n \n# Note:\n - All inputs are valid.\n - If no such substring found, return 0.\n - Please pay attention to the performance of code. ;-)\n - In the performance test(100000 brackets str x 100 testcases), the time consuming of each test case should be within 35ms. This means, your code should run as fast as a rocket ;-) \n \n# Some Examples\n ```\n findLongest(\"()\") === 2\n findLongest(\"()(\") === 2\n findLongest(\"()()\") === 4\n findLongest(\"()()(\") === 4\n findLongest(\"(()())\") === 6\n findLongest(\"(()(())\") === 6\n findLongest(\"())(()))\") === 4\n findLongest(\"))((\") === 0\n findLongest(\"\") === 0\n ```",
