  "prompt": "Lets wish Horsbug98 on his birthday and jump right into the question.\nIn Chefland, $6$ new mobile brands have appeared each providing a range of smartphones. For simplicity let the brands be represented by numbers $1$ to $6$. All phones are sold at the superstore. \nThere are total $N$ smartphones. Let $P_i$ & $B_i$ be the price and the brand of the $i^{th}$ smartphone. The superstore knows all the price and brand details beforehand. \nEach customer has a preference for brands. The preference is a subset of the brands available (i.e $1$ to $6$). Also, the customer will buy the $K^{th}$ costliest phone among all the phones of his preference.\nYou will be asked $Q$ queries. Each query consists of the preference of the customer and $K$.\nFind the price the customer has to pay for his preference. If no such phone is available, print $-1$\nNote that for each query the total number of smartphones is always $N$ since, after each purchase, the phones are replaced instantly.\n\n-----Input:-----\n- First Line contains $N$ and $Q$\n- Second-line contains $N$ integers $P_1,P_2,...,P_N$ (Price)\n- Third line contains $N$ integers $B_1,B_2,...,B_N$ (Brand)\n- Each of the next Q lines contains a query, the query is describes below\n- First line of each quey contains $b$ and $K$ where $b$ is the size of the preference subset.\n- Second line of each query contains $b$ integers, describing the preference subset.\n\n-----Output:-----\nFor each query, print the price to be paid.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq N, Q, P_i \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq B_i, b \\leq 6$\n- $1 \\leq K \\leq N$\n\n-----Sample Input:-----\n4 2\n4 5 6 7 \n1 2 3 4 \n3 3\n1 2 3\n3 4\n4 5 6 \n\n-----Sample Output:-----\n4\n\n-1\n\n-----Explaination-----\nQuery 1: The preference subset is {1, 2, 3}, The prices of phones available of these brands are {4, 5, 6}. The third costliest phone is 4.\nQuery 2: The preference subset is {4, 5, 6}, The prices of phones available of these brands are {7}.\nFouth costliest phone is required, which is not available. Hence, answer is $-1$.",
