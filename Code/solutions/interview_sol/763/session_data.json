  "prompt": "You are given two binary strings $S$ and $P$, each with length $N$. A binary string contains only characters '0' and '1'. For each valid $i$, let's denote the $i$-th character of $S$ by $S_i$.\nYou have to convert the string $S$ into $P$ using zero or more operations. In one operation, you should choose two indices $i$ and $j$ ($1 \\leq i < j \\leq N$) such that $S_i$ is '1' and $S_j$ is '0', and swap $S_i$ with $S_j$.\nDetermine if it is possible to convert $S$ into $P$ by performing some operations.\n\n-----Input-----\n- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.\n- The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.\n- The second line contains a single string $S$.\n- The third line contains a single string $P$.\n\n-----Output-----\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the string \"Yes\" if it is possible to convert $S$ into $P$ or \"No\" otherwise (without quotes).\n\n-----Constraints-----\n- $1 \\leq T \\leq 10^5$\n- $1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$\n- $S$ and $P$ contain only characters '0' and '1'\n- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\nSubtask #1 (20 points):\n- $N \\leq 14$\n- the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $100$\nSubtask #2 (30 points): the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $1,000$\nSubtask #3 (50 points): original constraints\n\n-----Example Input-----\n3\n2\n00\n00\n3\n101\n010\n4\n0110\n0011\n\n-----Example Output-----\nYes\nNo\nYes\n\n-----Explanation-----\nExample case 1: The strings are already equal.\nExample case 2: It can be showed that it is impossible to convert $S$ into $P$.\nExample case 3: You can swap $S_2$ with $S_4$. The strings will then be equal.",
