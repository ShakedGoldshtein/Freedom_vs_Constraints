  "prompt": "You have a large electronic screen which can display up to $998244353$ decimal digits. The digits are displayed in the same way as on different electronic alarm clocks: each place for a digit consists of $7$ segments which can be turned on and off to compose different digits. The following picture describes how you can display all $10$ decimal digits:\n\n[Image]\n\nAs you can see, different digits may require different number of segments to be turned on. For example, if you want to display $1$, you have to turn on $2$ segments of the screen, and if you want to display $8$, all $7$ segments of some place to display a digit should be turned on.\n\nYou want to display a really large integer on the screen. Unfortunately, the screen is bugged: no more than $n$ segments can be turned on simultaneously. So now you wonder what is the greatest integer that can be displayed by turning on no more than $n$ segments.\n\nYour program should be able to process $t$ different test cases.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 100$) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input.\n\nThen the test cases follow, each of them is represented by a separate line containing one integer $n$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^5$) \u2014 the maximum number of segments that can be turned on in the corresponding testcase.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases in the input does not exceed $10^5$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, print the greatest integer that can be displayed by turning on no more than $n$ segments of the screen. Note that the answer may not fit in the standard $32$-bit or $64$-bit integral data type.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n2\n3\n4\n\nOutput\n7\n11",
