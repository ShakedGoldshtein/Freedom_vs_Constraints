  "prompt": "Chef is frustrated in this lockown. So to overcome this he plans to travel various mountains.\nHe is very strange so he sets some conditions for $each$ Type 2 query(mentioned below) (i.e. $1$ $i$) : \n- Let Chef has travelled till $ith$ mountain from left to right.\n- He does not like to travel the mountain with the height ,of which he has travelled till now. More formally, \nLet the height of peak on which he is standing is $a_{i}$ then he can only go to the peak of height $a_{j}$ \nwhich is greater than $a_{i}$ and nearest to $ith$ mountain such that there should be no other peak of same height $a_{j}$ till $a_{i}$(height of $ith$ mountain) .\n\n-----Input format:-----\n- \nThe first line contains an integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.\n- \nThe second line of  consist of a integer $N$ and $Q$ .\n- \nThe third line contains $N$ not necessarily distinct positive integers $a_{0},a_{1}, . . .,a_{n-1}$ denoting the height of \n$N$ mountains.\n- \nThen next $Q$ lines follows where each line consisting of $either$ of $2$ types of queries:\nType 1:  $0$ $A$ $B$ i.e. $a_{A} = B$ (where height of $Ath$ mountain will be updated to $B$) \nType 2:  $1$ $A$ i.e. you have to answer $a_k$ which is greater than $a_{A}$ and nearest to $Ath$ mountain such that there should be no other peak of same height $a_{k}$ till $a_{A}$(height of $Ath$ mountain) .\n\n-----Output format:-----\n- For every query of Type 2 there should be an integer $a_{k}$ on next  line for the updated array , If no such $a_{k}$ exists then $a_{k}$= $-1$ , as query of type 1 will have no output . \n\n-----Constraints:-----\n- $1\\leq T \\leq 10^2$\n- $1 \\leq N,Q \\leq 10^4$\n- $0\\leq a_{i} \\leq 10^6$\n- $0\\leq B \\leq 10^6$\n- $0\\leq A \\leq N-1$\n\n-----Subtasks-----\n- \n1 Point :   \n$1 \\leq T,N,Q \\leq 10^2$ \n$0\\leq B,a_{i} \\leq 10^2$\n- \n99 Points : Orginal   Constraints\n\n-----Example:-----\n\n-----Input:-----\n1\n10 5\n1 3 5 4 5 6 7 8  4 5\n1 7\n1 3\n1 1\n0 2 7\n1 3\n\n-----Output:-----\n-1\n6\n5\n5",
