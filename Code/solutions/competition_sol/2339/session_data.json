  "prompt": "This is the easy version of the problem. The difference between the versions is the constraint on $n$ and the required number of operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.\n\nThere are two binary strings $a$ and $b$ of length $n$ (a binary string is a string consisting of symbols $0$ and $1$). In an operation, you select a prefix of $a$, and simultaneously invert the bits in the prefix ($0$ changes to $1$ and $1$ changes to $0$) and reverse the order of the bits in the prefix.\n\nFor example, if $a=001011$ and you select the prefix of length $3$, it becomes $011011$. Then if you select the entire string, it becomes $001001$.\n\nYour task is to transform the string $a$ into $b$ in at most $3n$ operations. It can be proved that it is always possible.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1\\le t\\le 1000$) \u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. Next $3t$ lines contain descriptions of test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1\\le n\\le 1000$) \u00a0\u2014 the length of the binary strings.\n\nThe next two lines contain two binary strings $a$ and $b$ of length $n$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $1000$.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, output an integer $k$ ($0\\le k\\le 3n$), followed by $k$ integers $p_1,\\ldots,p_k$ ($1\\le p_i\\le n$). Here $k$ is the number of operations you use and $p_i$ is the length of the prefix you flip in the $i$-th operation.\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5\n2\n01\n10\n5\n01011\n11100\n2\n01\n01\n10\n0110011011\n1000110100\n1\n0\n1\n\nOutput\n3 1 2 1\n6 5 2 5 3 1 2\n0\n9 4 1 2 10 4 1 2 1 5\n1 1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case, we have $01\\to 11\\to 00\\to 10$.\n\nIn the second test case, we have $01011\\to 00101\\to 11101\\to 01000\\to 10100\\to 00100\\to 11100$.\n\nIn the third test case, the strings are already the same. Another solution is to flip the prefix of length $2$, which will leave $a$ unchanged.",
