  "prompt": "Sherlock has a new girlfriend (so unlike him!). Valentine's day is coming and he wants to gift her some jewelry.\n\nHe bought n pieces of jewelry. The i-th piece has price equal to i + 1, that is, the prices of the jewelry are 2, 3, 4, ... n + 1.\n\nWatson gave Sherlock a challenge to color these jewelry pieces such that two pieces don't have the same color if the price of one piece is a prime divisor of the price of the other piece. Also, Watson asked him to minimize the number of different colors used.\n\nHelp Sherlock complete this trivial task.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line contains single integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 100000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of jewelry pieces.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe first line of output should contain a single integer k, the minimum number of colors that can be used to color the pieces of jewelry with the given constraints.\n\nThe next line should consist of n space-separated integers (between 1 and k) that specify the color of each piece in the order of increasing price.\n\nIf there are multiple ways to color the pieces using k colors, you can output any of them.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n\nOutput\n2\n1 1 2 \nInput\n4\n\nOutput\n2\n2 1 1 2\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first input, the colors for first, second and third pieces of jewelry having respective prices 2, 3 and 4 are 1, 1 and 2 respectively.\n\nIn this case, as 2 is a prime divisor of 4, colors of jewelry having prices 2 and 4 must be distinct.",
