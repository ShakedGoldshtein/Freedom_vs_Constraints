  "prompt": "You have unweighted tree of $n$ vertices. You have to assign a positive weight to each edge so that the following condition would hold:\n\n  For every two different leaves $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ of this tree, bitwise XOR of weights of all edges on the simple path between $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ has to be equal to $0$. \n\nNote that you can put very large positive integers (like $10^{(10^{10})}$).\n\nIt's guaranteed that such assignment always exists under given constraints. Now let's define $f$ as the number of distinct weights in assignment.\n\n [Image] In this example, assignment is valid, because bitwise XOR of all edge weights between every pair of leaves is $0$. $f$ value is $2$ here, because there are $2$ distinct edge weights($4$ and $5$).\n\n[Image] In this example, assignment is invalid, because bitwise XOR of all edge weights between vertex $1$ and vertex $6$ ($3, 4, 5, 4$) is not $0$. \n\nWhat are the minimum and the maximum possible values of $f$ for the given tree? Find and print both.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integer $n$ ($3 \\le n \\le 10^{5}$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices in given tree.\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $n-1$ lines contains two integers $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ ($1 \\le a_{i} \\lt b_{i} \\le n$)\u00a0\u2014 it means there is an edge between $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$. It is guaranteed that given graph forms tree of $n$ vertices.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint two integers\u00a0\u2014 the minimum and maximum possible value of $f$ can be made from valid assignment of given tree. Note that it's always possible to make an assignment under given constraints.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n1 3\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n5 6\n\nOutput\n1 4\n\nInput\n6\n1 3\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n4 6\n\nOutput\n3 3\n\nInput\n7\n1 2\n2 7\n3 4\n4 7\n5 6\n6 7\n\nOutput\n1 6\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, possible assignments for each minimum and maximum are described in picture below. Of course, there are multiple possible assignments for each minimum and maximum.  [Image] \n\nIn the second example, possible assignments for each minimum and maximum are described in picture below. The $f$ value of valid assignment of this tree is always $3$.  [Image] \n\nIn the third example, possible assignments for each minimum and maximum are described in picture below. Of course, there are multiple possible assignments for each minimum and maximum.  [Image]",
