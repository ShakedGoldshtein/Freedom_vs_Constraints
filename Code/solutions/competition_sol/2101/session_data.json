  "prompt": "Ujan has a lot of useless stuff in his drawers, a considerable part of which are his math notebooks: it is time to sort them out. This time he found an old dusty graph theory notebook with a description of a graph.\n\nIt is an undirected weighted graph on $n$ vertices. It is a complete graph: each pair of vertices is connected by an edge. The weight of each edge is either $0$ or $1$; exactly $m$ edges have weight $1$, and all others have weight $0$.\n\nSince Ujan doesn't really want to organize his notes, he decided to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph. (The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of all its edges.) Can you find the answer for Ujan so he stops procrastinating?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$, $0 \\leq m \\leq \\min(\\frac{n(n-1)}{2},10^5)$), the number of vertices and the number of edges of weight $1$ in the graph. \n\nThe $i$-th of the next $m$ lines contains two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1 \\leq a_i, b_i \\leq n$, $a_i \\neq b_i$), the endpoints of the $i$-th edge of weight $1$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that no edge appears twice in the input.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single integer, the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 11\n1 3\n1 4\n1 5\n1 6\n2 3\n2 4\n2 5\n2 6\n3 4\n3 5\n3 6\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n3 0\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe graph from the first sample is shown below. Dashed edges have weight $0$, other edges have weight $1$. One of the minimum spanning trees is highlighted in orange and has total weight $2$. [Image] \n\nIn the second sample, all edges have weight $0$ so any spanning tree has total weight $0$.",
