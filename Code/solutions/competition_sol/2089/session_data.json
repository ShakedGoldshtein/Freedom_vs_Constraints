  "prompt": "Petya learned a new programming language CALPAS. A program in this language always takes one non-negative integer and returns one non-negative integer as well.\n\nIn the language, there are only three commands: apply a bitwise operation AND, OR or XOR with a given constant to the current integer. A program can contain an arbitrary sequence of these operations with arbitrary constants from 0 to 1023. When the program is run, all operations are applied (in the given order) to the argument and in the end the result integer is returned.\n\nPetya wrote a program in this language, but it turned out to be too long. Write a program in CALPAS that does the same thing as the Petya's program, and consists of no more than 5 lines. Your program should return the same integer as Petya's program for all arguments from 0 to 1023.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 5\u00b710^5) \u2014 the number of lines.\n\nNext n lines contain commands. A command consists of a character that represents the operation (\"&\", \"|\" or \"^\" for AND, OR or XOR respectively), and the constant x_{i} 0 \u2264 x_{i} \u2264 1023.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput an integer k (0 \u2264 k \u2264 5) \u2014 the length of your program.\n\nNext k lines must contain commands in the same format as in the input.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n| 3\n^ 2\n| 1\n\nOutput\n2\n| 3\n^ 2\n\nInput\n3\n& 1\n& 3\n& 5\n\nOutput\n1\n& 1\n\nInput\n3\n^ 1\n^ 2\n^ 3\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nYou can read about bitwise operations in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nLet x be an input of the Petya's program. It's output is ((x&1)&3)&5 = x&(1&3&5) = x&1. So these two programs always give the same outputs.",
