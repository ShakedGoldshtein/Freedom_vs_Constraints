  "prompt": "For strings s and t, we will say that s and t are prefix-free when neither is a prefix of the other.\nLet L be a positive integer. A set of strings S is a good string set when the following conditions hold true:\n - Each string in S has a length between 1 and L (inclusive) and consists of the characters 0 and 1.\n - Any two distinct strings in S are prefix-free.\nWe have a good string set S = \\{ s_1, s_2, ..., s_N \\}. Alice and Bob will play a game against each other. They will alternately perform the following operation, starting from Alice:\n - Add a new string to S. After addition, S must still be a good string set.\nThe first player who becomes unable to perform the operation loses the game. Determine the winner of the game when both players play optimally.\n\n-----Constraints-----\n - 1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5\n - 1 \\leq L \\leq 10^{18}\n - s_1, s_2, ..., s_N are all distinct.\n - { s_1, s_2, ..., s_N } is a good string set.\n - |s_1| + |s_2| + ... + |s_N| \\leq 10^5\n\n-----Input-----\nInput is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN L\ns_1\ns_2\n:\ns_N\n\n-----Output-----\nIf Alice will win, print Alice; if Bob will win, print Bob.\n\n-----Sample Input-----\n2 2\n00\n01\n\n-----Sample Output-----\nAlice\n\nIf Alice adds 1, Bob will be unable to add a new string.",
