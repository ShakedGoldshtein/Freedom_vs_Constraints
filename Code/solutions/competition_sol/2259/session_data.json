  "prompt": "Let $a_1, \\ldots, a_n$ be an array of $n$ positive integers. In one operation, you can choose an index $i$ such that $a_i = i$, and remove $a_i$ from the array (after the removal, the remaining parts are concatenated).\n\nThe weight of $a$ is defined as the maximum number of elements you can remove.\n\nYou must answer $q$ independent queries $(x, y)$: after replacing the $x$ first elements of $a$ and the $y$ last elements of $a$ by $n+1$ (making them impossible to remove), what would be the weight of $a$?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \\le n, q \\le 3 \\cdot 10^5$) \u00a0\u2014 the length of the array and the number of queries.\n\nThe second line contains $n$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq n$)\u00a0\u2014 elements of the array.\n\nThe $i$-th of the next $q$ lines contains two integers $x$ and $y$ ($x, y \\ge 0$ and $x+y < n$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint $q$ lines, $i$-th line should contain a single integer \u00a0\u2014 the answer to the $i$-th query.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n13 5\n2 2 3 9 5 4 6 5 7 8 3 11 13\n3 1\n0 0\n2 4\n5 0\n0 12\n\nOutput\n5\n11\n6\n1\n0\n\nInput\n5 2\n1 4 1 2 4\n0 0\n1 0\n\nOutput\n2\n0\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nExplanation of the first query:\n\nAfter making first $x = 3$ and last $y = 1$ elements impossible to remove, $a$ becomes $[\\times, \\times, \\times, 9, 5, 4, 6, 5, 7, 8, 3, 11, \\times]$ (we represent $14$ as $\\times$ for clarity).\n\nHere is a strategy that removes $5$ elements (the element removed is colored in red):  $[\\times, \\times, \\times, 9, \\color{red}{5}, 4, 6, 5, 7, 8, 3, 11, \\times]$  $[\\times, \\times, \\times, 9, 4, 6, 5, 7, 8, 3, \\color{red}{11}, \\times]$  $[\\times, \\times, \\times, 9, 4, \\color{red}{6}, 5, 7, 8, 3, \\times]$  $[\\times, \\times, \\times, 9, 4, 5, 7, \\color{red}{8}, 3, \\times]$  $[\\times, \\times, \\times, 9, 4, 5, \\color{red}{7}, 3, \\times]$  $[\\times, \\times, \\times, 9, 4, 5, 3, \\times]$ (final state) \n\nIt is impossible to remove more than $5$ elements, hence the weight is $5$.",
